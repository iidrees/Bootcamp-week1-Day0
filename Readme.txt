This is the Readme file for the Week 1, Day zero Andela Bootcamp.

At the end of the Self Learning Clinic, we were given three tasks and tests to perform and carryout respectively.

The first task and test as respectively stated on the Trello board is to "Write a function to find the Maximum and Minimun elements of an array", and and also "You must create at least 10 test cases to test the code". As you will see from the first commit in this repo " Question1-MinMax.js", I did not successfully finish writing the codes that will test my testcases, however as you will see from the " Question1-MinMaxspec.js" file, I had at least 11 tests I intended to test my code with.

Although, I was not able to finish coding my answer to the first part of Question 1, I was able to complete the rest of my tasks and also successfully included at least 10 test cases to test the code with.

For clarification, the requirements of Questions 2 and 3 were:
Question 2; "Create a fizzBuzz function that checks for divisibility by 3 and/or 5" and as with question 1, it must be accompanied by at least 10 test cases.

Question 3; "Create an aritGeo function that checks if the array passed as an argument is an arithmetic or geometric progression", the same additional requirements in questions 1 and 2 applies here too.


How to Run the tests Using Node.js.

1. Open your Node.js Command Line Interface 

2. you install the Jasmine module using  npm into your node.js library by typing "npm install jasmine" (without the quotes), 

3. then you wait for a couple of minutes while you wait for the module to install. 

4. After installing jasmine, cd to the directory where your project is set up and type "jasmine init" (without the quotes) to initialise jasmine in that directory and then you can run your tests.
